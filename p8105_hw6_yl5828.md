In the plot, most cities are clustered close to 1 and most 95% CIs cross
the vertical line at 1, suggesting little evidence of large, consistent
differences in clearance rates by victim sex within most cities. A few
cities have ORs noticeably above 1, hinting that male-victim homicides
might be more likely to be solved there, but their CIs are wide, so
those estimates are fairly imprecise. Overall, there isn’t a strong
pattern by city.

From the plots, we could observe that the bootstrap distribution of R²
is approximately normal with a slight left skew, centered around 0.94,
which indicates the model consistently explains a high proportion of
variance in the data. In contrast, the distribution of the ratio β1 / β2
is heavily left-skewed with a significant tail extending toward more
negative values; this asymmetry suggests instability in the estimate,
likely caused by the denominator which is β2 the precipitation
coefficient, being very close to zero in certain bootstrap samples,
inflating the ratio.

My modeling process began with using cross-validation to compare three
models, the results show that the simple main effects model (length +
gestational age only) has the highest RMSE (mean around 330 grams),
indicating substantial underfitting and poor predictive performance. In
contrast, both the interactions model (head circumference × length × sex
with three-way interaction) and my proposed model show significantly
better prediction accuracy with similar RMSE values (mean about 290
grams). While the interactions model captures complex relationships
among physical measurements, my proposed model offers better
interpretability by explicitly incorporating clinically meaningful
variables like maternal smoking and BMI, making it more useful for
understanding modifiable risk factors. The residual plot for my proposed
model shows relatively random scatter around zero with no obvious
patterns, suggesting the model adequately captures the underlying
relationships and meets linear regression assumptions, though some
slight heteroscedasticity may be present at extreme fitted values.
